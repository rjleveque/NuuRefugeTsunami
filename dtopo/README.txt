Run
    python MakeSlumpDeformation.py	
to create dtopo files for the three slumps of different amplitudes:
    slump_05m.dtt3
    slump_10m.dtt3
    slump_15m.dtt3
    
An animation of the 10 m slump evolution is also created,
    slump_10m.mp4
    
The Python script was created from the Juptyer notebook
    MakeSlumpDeformation.ipynb 
and a rendered version of this notebook can be viewed at
